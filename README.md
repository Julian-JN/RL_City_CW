Reinforcement Learning Coursework.

For tabular Q-Learning (Task 1), the main modules are `maze_env.py` and `agent.py` which describe the environment and the Q-Learning agent that learns on the environment, respectively.

For Deep Q-Learning, DQN (Advanced Task), the main modules are `dqn.py` which describes the neural networks and trains it (saving the checkpoints) and `dqn_inference.py` which loads a checkpoint from the `rl_chk` directory and generates a video. Note that the videos have already are already been loaded in the directory `videos`.

The repository has two branches, showcasing the individual parts of the coursework with different Atari environments.
